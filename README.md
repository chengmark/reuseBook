## Collaboration

- Main branch is for deployment.

- _Discard the approach of backend, frontend branching (17/3/2021)_
- Create a new branch whenever you want to add a new feature/debug/refactor/etc.

```
This is a recommended format for branch names
build/changes-on-the-deployment
docs/write-some-documentation
feat/add-a-new-feature
fix/fix-a-bug
refactor/rename-a-file-or-folder
test/test-some-functions
you may also want to use these formats in your commit comments
```

- Create pull request when ever you want to merge things to the main branch.
- Commit your code after you have tested it.
- Prettier will be run in the pre-commit stage.
- Cite code reference in the "References" section below.

## UI libraries used

- [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) for creating highly customized css-in-js componenets

## Dev packages used

- **react-router-dom**( component routing )
- **react-hot-loader**( enables hot reload which facilitate development )
- **react-app-rewired/react-app-rewire-hot-reloader**( tweak webpack config without ejecting )
- **react-loadable**( dynamic import which enalbes code-spliting in route level )
- **prettier/eslint**( keeping coding style consistency )
